    paragraph1: "$DROP isn't just another meme coin — it's the first fee-rain experiment on Pump.fun. Every trade generates fees, and instead of vanishing, those fees collect in the Rain Pool. At the top of every hour, the clouds burst and eligible holders are showered in SOL rewards.",
    paragraph2: "But here's the twist: The bigger our market cap grows, the harder the storm hits. At $5k market cap, the first Rain falls with 1 winner. At $100k, 2 winners. At $500k, 5 winners. At $1M, 10 winners. And for every million beyond, another 10 winners join the hourly Rain. All you need to do: Buy. Hold. Connect. Win. One wallet = one ticket, as long as you hold the minimum amount of $DROP. With $DROP, the storm never stops building. The more we grow, the more it rains. 🌩️",
